Java 10 - Core Basics for Review

This is a simple Java project for brushing up on (and/or) experimenting with basic, core Java techniques. Each technique is encapsulated in a separate operation class. There is also an "Application" class that contains the main function. All this does is basically act like a script that instantiates the operation objects and calls them. 

The project also contains test units that can test each operation object individually. So I can run all the operations in sequence by running the project as a Java Application, or I can run each operation separately using JUNIT 5.

02/10/20 - Adding a test branch to the pipeline.

09/19/21 - Added a switch "0" or "1" as a command line argument, captured by args[0] to evaluate whether or not to run the oracle tests.
